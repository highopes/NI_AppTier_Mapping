# NI_AppTier_Mapping

## Description


Cisco AppDynamics can be integrated in Cisco Nexus Insights 5.x and can be traced from AppDynamics anomalies to corresponding NI anomalies, such as the corresponding flows. For network teams, in many cases the first thing they observe is an infrastructure anomaly reported in NI, and because they are unaware of the application it's associated with, network teams miss the opportunity to work closely with the application team to improve the application experience. But NI's GUI does not provide the ability to trace back from infrastructure anomalies to the application's name, tiers, and nodes. The program anom2apps.py extracts the anomalies of concern from NI and maps them to the corresponding application names, tiers, and nodes.


Currently the NI_AppTier_Mapping is used only for demo purpose. For productive usage, please contact the author at: weihang_hank@gmail.com
